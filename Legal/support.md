# PrepTick Support

## How timers work
- **Presets:** Create presets with names, durations, and optional categories so you can start cooking timers quickly.
- **Favourites:** Mark presets as favourites to keep them close on the Home tab.
- **Running multiple timers:** Start multiple presets at once; each runs independently and can be paused, resumed, or adjusted.
- **Repeat last set:** Use **Repeat last set** to restart the most recent combination of presets in one tap.

## Notification tips
- **Allow alerts:** Enable notifications in iOS Settings → Notifications → PrepTick so timer alerts can appear when the app is closed.
- **Silent mode:** Turn on **Silent mode** in Settings if you want alerts without sound.
- **If alerts stop:** Ensure Focus/Do Not Disturb is off, keep the device unlocked after granting permission, and reopen PrepTick to reschedule pending notifications.
