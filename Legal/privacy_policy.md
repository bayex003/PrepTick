# PrepTick Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 2024**

PrepTick is designed to run offline-first and keep your cooking timers private. We do not operate an account system, collect analytics, or use tracking technologies. All data stays on your device unless you choose to delete the app or share information yourself.

## Data We Store
- **Presets and favourites:** Names, durations, and any categories you create for your timers.
- **Running timers:** Timing state needed to keep your timers in sync with local notifications.
- **Settings:** Preferences like alerts enabled, silent mode, and accent colour.
- **Last set history:** The most recent presets you started so you can quickly repeat them.

This information is stored locally in iOS **UserDefaults**. PrepTick does not send this data to our servers or third parties.

## Notifications
PrepTick schedules **local notifications** on your device to alert you when timers complete. Notification content stays on device and is not shared externally.

## No Tracking or Analytics
- **No accounts or login.**
- **No analytics.** We do not measure usage or performance.
- **No tracking.** We do not share data with advertisers or data brokers.
- **No third-party SDKs.**

## Data Deletion
- **In-app reset:** Use **Settings → Reset App Data** to clear presets, running timers, settings, and recent sets. Onboarding remains marked as completed so you return directly to the app.
- **Delete the app:** Removing PrepTick from your device deletes all locally stored data and notifications.
